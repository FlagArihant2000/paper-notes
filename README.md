# Paper Notes

This repository consists of some of my paper notes. Most of the papers will be from the areas of computer vision (geometry as well as deep learning based), basic image processing and localization (mostly pure vision based). I have used [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) for most of my notes.

It will be really great if the user of this repository suggests any errors in my notes. Also please star if this was useful for you!
